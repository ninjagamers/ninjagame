    ABOUT THE GAME:<br>
    This game was designed as part of an assessment for a programming course.<br>
    The inspiration came from the initial ideas of reversing gravity in some
    sort of flying<br>
    movement and spawning levels for scrolling.<br>
    From here we chose our ninja character and worked to develop the game from
    there.<br>
    Most graphics, audio and program was created for this game.<br>
