    <h3 class="Title3">ABOUT THE GAME:</h3>
    <p>This game was designed as part of an assessment for a programming course.<br>
    The inspiration came from the initial ideas of reversing gravity in some
    sort of flying<br>
    movement and spawning levels for scrolling.<br>
    From here we chose our ninja character and worked to develop the game from
    there.<br>
    Most graphics, audio and program was created for this game.<br>
